# How Computers Work
## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
#### thinking machine do 4 task 
1. take inputs : stuff that make computer to do something
2. store information : storge the information inside the computer for next step
3. processing information : take information from memory and make to manipulate it using algorithm and then send the procssed information back to be stored in memory again
4. output result : different type of visual or actions output

## Binary & Data
#### binary : it's a system that use (1,0) count it represent (Ture , False) or ( ON,OFF)
#### we use it in machine like a computer , when the electricity pass the one wire that will be (0,1) that we call bit , so when increase the wire we increase number of bit so we can enter more data 
#### we represent the data by numbers , the Decimal number can be convert to binary by rules it follow 1 and 0 .
#### when we have as so many possiple of wire that make a lot of bits so it can make better data .

## Circuits and Logic
* ### Circuits
#### a millions of teeny electronic components are process the informaition that comes in as input , and to make the information that is output a computer needs to modify and combine the input signals
* ### Logic
#### we have a multible logic circuts and gaites ( Not , and , or and more .. ) and we can make more complex circuits that perform more complex calculations
### we can use adder with diff number of adder gaites 4,8,... , subtraction , multiplication ,..etc

#### *note* : the smallest computer fast becuase the smaller circuit is, the less distence the electrical signal has to go.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output 

### CPU
#### The GPU or Graphics Processing Unit is specialized to crunch numbers efficiently to output smooth graphics from something like a video game. The CPU can basically do anything but since the architecture of the GPU is more efficient for rendering graphics it hands the workload to the GPU. Both are types of microprocessers that handle different tasks. The GPU is generally divided up into many cores whereas the CPU is only split into a few cores. GPUs are also used for mining cryptocurrencies since they can crunch numbers so quickly. 

### Memory 
#### Memory refers to the processes that are used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are three major processes involved in memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval.

## Hardware and Software
### Hardware
#### it's the circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs and other stuff that you can see it in computers

### Software
#### is all of computer programs or code running on this machine

#### CPU is the master chip that control all the other parts of the computer (Brain of the computer) with circiut to do simple math and logic and other one to send and recevie information to and different part of the computer.

### today we use programming languages as a translitor between the human and the machine to understand each other
#### so at the end and first we need operation system to operate the program that make sogtware to manage hardware of computer and this is make us to learn coding or programming.
