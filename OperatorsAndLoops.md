####  Operators and Loops


## Comparison and Logical Operators

### Comparison operators â€” operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !==.
### Logical operators â€” operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output. The operators include: &&, ||, and !.
### Comparison Operators ### You may be familiar with comparison operators from math class. Letâ€™s make sure there arenâ€™t any gaps in your knowledge.


### Less than (<) â€” returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
### Greater than (>) â€” returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
### Less than or equal to (<=) â€” returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
### Greater than or equal to (>=) â€” returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
### Equal to (===) â€” returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
### Not equal to (!==) â€” returns true if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
### Logical Operators
### Comparison operators allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. For example, we can assert whether two values or expressions are equal with ===, or, whether one value is greater than another with >.



## Loops check a condition, if it returns true, a code block will run.
## Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. 
## There are three common types of loops:
## for, while, do while

## A for loop uses a counter as a condition.
## This instructs the code to run a specified number of times.
## Here you can see the condition is made up of three statements: 
## Initilization, condition and update
