# HTML Summaries
#### Html (hypertext markup language) is a code language that can make the website structure and it markup the browser and tell him about the website.

## * Old HTML VS New HTML
#### Web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar).
#### But today with HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already

## * The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
#### *	The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. - A header or footer for an individual <article> or section> within the page
