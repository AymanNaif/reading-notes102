#### JavaScript & jQuery:

## How javascript makes web pages more interactive :
1. ACCESS CONTENT:You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from anHTML page.
2. MODIFY CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. 
3. PROGRAM RULES: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
4. REACT TO EVENTS: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

## WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 
Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps. 
1. DEFINE THE GOAL: First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve. 
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT: To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. 
3. CODE EACH STEP: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. 

## EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE Example :

var color = 'beige'; 

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE  EXAMPLE : 

var area = 3 * 2; 

## OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers.  You may remember some from math class.

## Functions
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: 

* The name of the function.

* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
