## What is Git ?
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

##### there is a lot of insturctur that we can use it with git - if we want to upload our project to GitHub we follow git add - git commit -m - git push (ACP) *note* we write on **Terminal**
